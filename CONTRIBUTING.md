## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred way for tracking [bug reports](#bug-reports), [feature requests](#feature-requests),
and [submitted pull requests](#pull-requests), but please follow these guidelines for the issue tracker:

* Please __do not__ use the issue tracker for personal issues and/or support requests. 
The [Discussions](#discussions) page is a better place to get help for personal support requests.

* Please __do not__ derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on track and have respect for the other 
users/contributors of slurmd-operator.

* Please __do not__ post comments consisting solely of "+1", ":thumbsup:", or something similar. 
Use [GitHub's "reactions" feature](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) 
instead.
  * The maintainers of slurmd-operator reserve the right to delete comments that violate this rule.

* Please __do not__ repost or reopen issues that have been closed. Please either 
submit a new issue or browser through previous issues.
  * The maintainers of slurmd-operator reserve the right to delete issues that violate this rule.

## Issues and Labels

The slurmd-operator issue tracker uses a variety of labels to help organize and identify issues. 
Here is a list of some of these labels, and how the maintainers of slurmd-operator use them:

* `Type: Bug` - Issues reported in the slurmd-operator source code that either produce errors or unexpected behavior.

* `Status: Confirmed` - Issues marked `Type: Bug` that have be confirmed to be reproducible on a separate system.

* `Type: Documentation` - Issues for improving or updating slurmd-operator's documentation. 
Can also be used for pull requests.

* `Type: Refactor` - Issues that pertain to improving the existing slurmd-operator code base.

* `Type: Idea Bank` - Issues that pertain to proposing potential improvement to slurmd-operator.

* `Type: Enhancement` - Issues marked as an agreed upon enhancement to slurmd-operator. Can also be used for pull requests.

* `Statues: Help wanted` - Issues where we need help from the greater slurmd-operator community to solve.

For a complete look at slurmd-operator's labels, see the 
[project labels page](https://github.com/omnivector-solutions/slurmd-operator/labels).

## Bug Reports

A bug is a *demonstrable problem* that is caused by slurmd-operator. Good bug reports make slurmd-operator more robust, so thank 
you for taking the time to report issues in the source code!

Guidelines for reporting bugs in slurmd-operator:

1. __Validate your testlet__ &mdash; ensure that your issue is not being caused by either a semantic or syntactic 
error in your testlet's code.

2. __Use the GitHub issue search__ &mdash; check if the issue you are encountering has already been reported by 
someone else.

3. __Check if the issue has already been fixed__ &mdash; try to reproduce your issue using the latest `main` 
in the slurmd-operator repository.

4. __Isolate the problem__ &mdash; the more pinpointed the issue is, the easier time the slurmd-operator developers 
will have fixing it.

A good bug report should not leave others needing to chase you for more information. 
Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? 
What operating system are you experiencing the problem on? Have you had the same results on a different 
operating system? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help the developers fix any 
potential bugs.

## Feature Requests

All feature requests should be posted to GitHub Discussions and tagged as `Type: Idea Bank`. The maintainers of
slurmd-operator already know the features they want to incorporate into slurmd-operator, but they are always open to 
new ideas and potential improvements. GitHub Discussions is the best place to post these types of requests 
because it allows for feedback from the entire community and does not bloat the issue tracker. Please note that not 
all feature requests will be incorporated into slurmd-operator. Also, feature requests posted on the issue tracker 
will be tagged as `Type: Invalid` and closed. Lastly, please note that spamming the maintainers to incorporate a
feature you want into slurmd-operator will not improve its likelihood of being implemented; it may result in you receiving
a temporary ban from the repository.

## Pull Requests

Good pull requests &mdash; patches, improvements, new features &mdash; are a huge help. These pull requests should 
remain focused in scope and should not contain unrelated commits.

__Ask first__ before embarking on any __significant__ pull request (e.g. implementing new features, refactoring code, 
incorporating a new test environment provider, etc.), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something 
that slurmd-operator's developers might not want to merge into the project! For trivial things, or things that do not require 
a lot of your time, you can go ahead and make a pull request.

Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work
included in the project:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/slurmd-operator.git
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd slurmd-operator
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/omnivector-solutions/slurmd-operator.git
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, pull the latest changes from the upstream slurmd-operator repository:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Ensure that your changes pass all tests:

    ```bash
    tox run -e fmt
    tox run -e lint
    tox run -e unit
    tox run -e integration
    ```

5. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit
   message guidelines](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   or your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

6. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream main
   ```

7. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

8. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description against the `main` branch.

__IMPORTANT__: By submitting a patch, improvement, or new feature, you agree to allow the maintainers of slurmd-operator to 
license your contributions under the terms of the [Apache Software License, version 2.0](./LICENSE).
